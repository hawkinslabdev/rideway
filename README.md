## Why Rideway?

Ever forgot when you last changed your oil? Lost track of maintenance receipts? Wondered if those fork seals are due for service? Rideway solves all that with:

- **üîß Maintenance Tracking** - Set it once, and get reminded based on miles or time
- **üìù Complete Service History** - Every oil change, valve adjustment, and tire swap in one place
- **üí∞ Cost Management** - Know exactly what you're spending on each bike
- **üìä Visual Dashboard** - See what's due at a glance with color-coded priorities
- **üíæ Data Backup** - Export everything as JSON and never lose your records
- **üì± Mobile Friendly** - Check your maintenance schedule from the garage or on the road

## Built for Riders, by Riders

We use modern web tech that just works:
- Next.js 15 with TypeScript for speed and reliability
- SQLite database - your data stays on your machine
- Clean, responsive design with Tailwind CSS
- Secure authentication to keep your garage private
- Charts and graphs to visualize your maintenance costs

## Deployment

Rideway is built to be easy to deploy with minimal setup. Choose your preferred method:

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

The simplest way to run Rideway is with Docker:

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v rideway-data:/app/data \
  -v rideway-uploads:/app/public/uploads \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-me-in-production \
  --name rideway \
  ghcr.io/melosso/rideway:latest
```

Then open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Option 2: Docker Compose

For more control and easier setup, use Docker Compose:

1. Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
services:
  rideway-app:
    image: ghcr.io/melosso/rideway:latest
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - rideway-data:/app/data
      - rideway-uploads:/app/public/uploads 
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000
      - NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-me-in-production
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  rideway-data:
  rideway-uploads:
```

2. Start the container:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

3. Open your browser to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Option 3: Heroku

### Environment Variables

Customize your Rideway instance with these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | Your site URL | `http://localhost:3000` |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | Secret key for sessions | *Required* |
| `DEFAULT_UNITS` | Default units (metric/imperial) | `metric` |
| `DEFAULT_LANGUAGE` | Default language | `en` |
| `DEFAULT_THEME` | Default theme (light/dark) | `light` |
| `DEFAULT_CURRENCY` | Default currency code | `EUR` |

## User Management & Password Reset

If a user has lost their password, you can use the built-in admin tool to reset it:

```bash
# For Docker:
docker exec rideway node -r esbuild-register app/scripts/reset-password.js generate john@example.com

# For Docker Compose:
docker compose exec rideway-app node -r esbuild-register app/scripts/reset-password.js generate john@example.com
```

This will generate a reset URL you can share with the user:
```
https://your-website.com/auth/reset-password/<token-here>
```

You can also reset the password directly via command line:
```bash
docker exec rideway node -r esbuild-register app/scripts/reset-password.js reset <TOKEN> "new-secure-password"
```
